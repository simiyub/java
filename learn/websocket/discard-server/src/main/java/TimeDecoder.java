/**
* 1) ByteToMessageDecoder is an implementation of ChannelInboundHandler which makes it easy to deal
 * with the fragmentation issue.
 * 2) ByteToMessageDecoder calls the decode() method with an internally maintained cumulative buffer
 * whenever new data is received.
 * 3) decode() can decide to add nothing to out when there is not enough data in the cumulative buffer.
 * ByteToMessageDecoder will call decode() again when there is more data received.
 * 4) If decode() adds an object to out, it means the decoder decoded a message successfully.
 * ByteToMessageDecoder will discard the read part of the cumulative buffer.
 * Please remember that you don't need to decode multiple messages.
 * ByteToMessageDecoder will keep calling the decode() method until it adds nothing to out.
